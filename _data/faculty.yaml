    I direct the research of the Sensing and Processing Across Networks (SPAN) lab. 
    Our lab specializes in statistical signal processing applied to wireless networks. 
    One focus area is radio channel signal processing, that is, when the radio 
    network is a sensor itself. We investigate how a network may use 
    radio measurements to monitor itself, to locate and synchronize the nodes in the 
    network, to learn about physical environment in which it is deployed, to improve 
    network security, and to improve the network deployment process. Research in 
    the SPAN lab applies results from estimation and detection theory, 
    radio propagation, wireless communications and networking.  We have several 
    research projects in the "Internet-of-things" and "cyber-physical systems" areas.
